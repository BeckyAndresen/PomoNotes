# Setup via VS Code Remote Containers With Ruby on Rails + MySQL

[VS Code Remote Containers Development docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)

## Prerequisites

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (tested with 19.03.13, build 4484c46d9d)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (tested with 1.27.4, build 40524192))

## Steps

1. Clone the repository
1. Open cloned directory in VS Code
1. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container"
1. Wait for docker image to build
1. Open a new terminal inside VS Code. By default this will occur within the development container
1. Install server-side dependencies

    ```bundle install```
1. Install client-sided dependencies

    ```yarn install```
1. Serve the app on port `3000`.

    ```rails s -b 0.0.0.0 -p 3000```
1. Visit the app in your browser

    ```http://localhost:3000```

1. (Optional) Explore the database via phpMyAdmin

    ```http://localhost:8080```
    
    Authenticate using credentials found in `docker-compose.yml` (`services:db:environment`)

1. (Optional) If you prefer a different database client, you may connect it to `localhost:3306` using credentials found in `docker-compose.yml` (`services:db:environment`).
